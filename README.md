Duration:8 weeks( 1st june to 30th july)

mentor: sravani gouni



### Overview

In this task, we designed a Finite State Machine (FSM) using Verilog to detect a specific sequence of bits ("101"). The FSM was implemented with four states, with state transitions defined based on the input bit. The output is asserted when the sequence "101" is detected. We also wrote a testbench to test the FSM by applying a sequence of inputs and observing the outputs. The simulation was run to verify the correctness of the FSM behavior.

### Conclusion

By designing and simulating the FSM, we demonstrated the capability to implement sequential logic using Verilog. The testbench helped in verifying the FSM's behavior across different states and transitions, ensuring its correctness. This process provided insights into state machine design, state transition logic, and verification techniques in digital design using Verilog.
